This is a prototype workflow engine that runs as an MPI job.

It has only been tested with Open MPI on my laptop.

The workflows are simple DAGs described in a format similar to what Condor
DAGMan uses. There are some examples in the test directory.

To build it do:

	$ make

To run tests do:

	$ make test

To run a workflow do:

    $ mpirun -n 4 mpidag test/diamond.dag

The scheduling is very basic round-robin, with no task prioritization.

The stdout/stderr of jobs is not currently captured. It should be forwarded
to the stdout/stderr of the master though.
