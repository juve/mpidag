This is a list of items that are planned in future versions of mpidag.

* Separate DAG and WorkflowEngine
* Add task runtimes and exitcodes in rescue file (e.g. DONE foo 1 10.0000)
* Allow tries to be specified with -t/--tries in DAG (e.g. TASK foo --tries 3 /bin/date)
* Enable priorities in DAG with -p/--priority (e.g. TASK foo --priority 10 /bin/date)
